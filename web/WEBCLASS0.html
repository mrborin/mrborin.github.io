        <p>Introduce:<p>
<p1>The relationship between Html and CSS
Learn the basics of web front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a look at what these three technologies are all about:<br>
1. HTML is the carrier of web content. The content is the information that the web designer puts on the page to let the user browse, including text, pictures, video, etc.<br>
2. CSS styles are performance. It's like a web page. For example, title fonts, color changes, or background images, borders, etc. All of these things that are used to change the appearance of the content are called performance.<br>
3. JavaScript is used to achieve special effects on web pages. Example: mouse over the pop-up drop-down menu. Or mouse over the background color of the table. There is also a rotation of focus news (news photos). As you can see, there are animated, interactive things that are typically implemented in JavaScript.</p1><br>
