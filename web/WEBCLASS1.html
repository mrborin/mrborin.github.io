The relationship between Html and CSS<br>
Learn the basics of web front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a look at what these three technologies are all about:<br>
1. HTML is the carrier of web content. The content is the information that the web designer puts on the page to let the user browse, including text, pictures, video, etc.<br>
2. CSS styles are performance. It's like a web page. For example, title fonts, color changes, or background images, borders, etc. All of these things that are used to change the appearance of the content are called performance.<br>
3. JavaScript is used to achieve special effects on web pages. Example: mouse over the pop-up drop-down menu. Or mouse over the background color of the table. There is also a rotation of focus news (news photos). As you can see, there are animated, interactive things that are typically implemented in JavaScript.<br><br>

1. HTML tags are case-insensitive, and &lth1&gt and &lth1&gt are the same, but case sensitive, since most programmers are lowercase.<br><br>
1-3<br>
An HTML file has its own fixed structure.<br>
&ltHTML&gt<br>
The &lthead &gt... The &lt/ head &gt<br>
The &lt body &gt... The &lt / body &gt<br>
The &lt / HTML &gt<br>
Code explanation:<br>
1. &lt HTML &gt is called the root tag, all the web tags are in &lt HTML &gt.<br>
2. tag is used to define the header of the document, which is a container for all header elements. The head element has &lt title &gt, &lt script &gt,&lt style &gt, &lt link &gt, &lt meta &gt, etc. The head tag will be detailed in the next section.<br>
3. Contents of and tags are the main contents of the web page, such as &lt h1 &gt, &lt p &gt,&lt a &gt,&lt img &gt and other web content labels, and the contents of the labels here will be displayed in the browser<br><br>
1-4<br>
1. The following tags can be used in the head section:<br>
The &lt head &gt<br>
The &lt title &gt... &lt / title &gt<br>
The &lt meta &gt<br>
&lt link &gt<br>
The &lt style &gt... &lt / style &gt<br>
&lt script &gt... &lt / script &gt<br>
The &lt / head &gt<br>
2, code comments are not only easier for programmers to recall code before use, can also help other programmers quickly read your program function convenient on cooperative development code page.<br>
Grammar:<br>
-- comment text --><br>
3. CSS comment code<br>
As in Html comments, there are comment statements in CSS: use /* comment statements */ to indicate (use - comment statement ->)<br>
From 1 to 5<br>
1, semantic, said popular point is: to understand the purpose of each label (under what circumstances can I use this tag to reasonable), for example, the title for the article with the title tag, web page of each section of column names can also use the title tag.<br>
2. The role of semantics<br>
1). It is easier to be included in the search engine.<br>
2). It is easier for screen readers to read the content of web pages.<br>
